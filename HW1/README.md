Solutions for Homework 1 for DS 5500 - Information Visualization: Applications in Data Science

### Problem 1
##### What score did you receive? Did any of the answers surprise you?
I scored 69% and yes almost half of the answers were surprising. Irrespective the environmental damage we do, the natural disaster damages to mankind life has decreased to less than half.

##### Choose a question from the test, re-state it, and answer it using visualization and summarization. Provide a figure and any relevant output with your answer.
* Worked on data of extreme poverty percent of people whose wage is below USD  1.90/ùëëùëéùë¶. 
* The proportion of people living in extreme poverty as almost reduced by half.

##### Interpretation
* The world income is growing each year since 1800.
* But there was a lag inbetween where during the period of 1800 to mid 1900, the growth of income is slow and there might plenty of reasons like technology, low population, low demands and supplies, wars etc.
* There were couple of recision in between mid 1900 and 2010.
* African countries had lower income(GDP per capita) constantly.

### Problem 3

##### Interpretations
* There is strong correlation observed between income (GDP / capita), life expectancy, and child mortality over time.
* There is a positive correlation between GDP and Life expectancy.
* Negative correlation between GDP and child mortality rates and also child mortality rates and life expectancy.

### Problem 4

##### Interpretations

The female school data represents mean years in school spent by women of age 25 to 34 years. Also taking the population of female from age 20 to 39. Now calculating the female count who have attended school during 25 to 34 years and plotting it.It is pretty much almost 60% of the female population have attended schools.

### Problem 5

##### Did you use static or interactive plots to answer the previous problems?
A mix of both static and interative plots.

##### Explore the data using the interactive visualization tools at https://www.gapminder.org/tools, and watch the TED talk ‚ÄúThe best stats you‚Äôve ever seen‚Äù at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w.
Tried visualization tools in gapminder site and watched the video as well.

##### Discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and relative usefulness of using interactive/dynamic visualizations versus static visualizations.
* Static plots
    * They are still, they can be downloaded and saved, good for simple data with small range
* Dynamic plots
    * Animated plots with interaction involved, can customize the data we want to see in the plot, best for large range of voluminous data
